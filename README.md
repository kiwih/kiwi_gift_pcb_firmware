# kiwi_gift_pcb_firmware

This project contains firmware for the "kia ora!" gift PCB from Hammond.

It contains four pieces of functionality, related to the USB connection and the three "LED Programs" that the firmware runs (program one "fills" it like a fluid, program two "illuminates/deilluminates" all, and program three "sparkles").

You may use this as basis to extend the firmware.
